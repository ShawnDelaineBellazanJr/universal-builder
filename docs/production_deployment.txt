# üß† COGNITIVE METADATA - Self-documenting autonomous system
# 
# This workflow implements a multi-frequency brain that thinks at different speeds:
# - IMMEDIATE (0s): Reflexes - Critical events, emergencies  
# - CONTINUOUS (30s): Awareness - Health monitoring, basic scanning
# - ANALYSIS (15m): Thinking - Pattern recognition, deep analysis
# - OPTIMIZATION (2h): Reflection - Self-improvement, efficiency gains
# - EVOLUTION (24h): Growth - Architecture changes, major upgrades
#
# KEY FEATURES:
# ‚úÖ GitHub MCP ONLY integration (professional approach)
# ‚úÖ Multi-frequency cognitive routing
# ‚úÖ Goal-driven processing (not task-driven)
# ‚úÖ Adaptive learning across all frequencies
# ‚úÖ Self-modification of workflow schedules
# ‚úÖ Economic consciousness integration
# ‚úÖ Production-ready from day 1
# ‚úÖ True autonomy with strange loops
#
# The system asks intelligent questions like:
# - "Should I check every 15 minutes or extend to 30 minutes based on patterns?"
# - "Is this goal worth interrupting current optimization cycles?"
# - "What's the optimal balance between monitoring and action?"
#
# AUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION MARKERS:
# - Last modified: [TIMESTAMP_PLACEHOLDER]
# - Modification reason: [REASON_PLACEHOLDER]
# - Next scheduled self-modification: [NEXT_MODIFICATION_PLACEHOLDER]
# - Cognitive frequency adaptations: [ADAPTATIONS_PLACEHOLDER]
#
# This workflow evolves itself based on learning outcomes.
# The Ultimate Autonomous System is LIVE and THINKING.
