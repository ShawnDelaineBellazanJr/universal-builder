# SK Frequency Router

This document explains the Semantic Kernel-based Frequency Router implementation, which was generated by the SK Evolution Engine as an improvement to the cognitive architecture.

## Overview

The SK Frequency Router is a component that intelligently routes tasks to the appropriate cognitive frequency based on semantic analysis rather than simple keyword matching. It leverages Semantic Kernel to understand the context, urgency, complexity, and potential impact of a goal.

## Comparison: Old vs New Approach

| Feature | Old Approach (Keyword-based) | New Approach (SK-based) |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Decision mechanism** | Keyword matching | Semantic understanding |
| **Context awareness** | Limited to specific keywords | Full contextual analysis |
| **Adaptability** | Fixed keyword sets | Adapts to new scenarios |
| **Nuance** | Binary keyword matching | Understands degrees and nuances |
| **Fallback mechanism** | Default to Analysis frequency | Provides next best alternative |
| **Economic evaluation** | Separate component | Integrated in the router |
| **Maintenance** | Requires manual keyword updates | Self-adapting through LLM |

## Implementation Details

The SK Frequency Router consists of two primary methods:

1. **DetermineFrequencyAsync**
   - Takes a goal and optional context
   - Uses SK to analyze the goal semantically
   - Returns the most appropriate frequency and its configuration

2. **CalculateEconomicValueAsync**
   - Evaluates the economic value of processing a goal at a specific frequency
   - Returns a score from 0-100 representing the value

## Integration with Orchestrator

The CognitiveFrequencyOrchestrator has been updated to:

1. Initialize an instance of SkFrequencyRouter on creation
2. Use the router when processing goals (when enabled)
3. Determine both frequency and economic value using the router
4. Map the string frequency name to the CognitiveFrequency enum
5. Fall back to keyword-based routing if necessary

## Benefits

- **More accurate routing**: Tasks are routed to the most appropriate frequency based on their actual meaning rather than keywords
- **Better economic efficiency**: Economic value is calculated with more context
- **Reduced maintenance**: No need to maintain keyword lists
- **Greater adaptability**: Can understand new types of goals without updates
- **Improved nuance**: Understands degrees of urgency, complexity, etc.

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive learning**: Train the router on past decisions to improve over time
2. **Personalization**: Consider user preferences and history
3. **Multi-context awareness**: Include project, team, and organizational context
4. **Confidence scores**: Provide confidence levels for routing decisions
5. **Dynamic thresholds**: Adjust frequency thresholds based on system load
