# SK Evolution Engine: Implement Semantic Kernel-based Frequency Router

This PR implements one of the improvements proposed by the SK Evolution Engine:

## Improvement Details

- **Title**: Implement Semantic Kernel-based Frequency Router
- **Description**: Create a cognitive frequency router that uses SK to determine which cognitive frequency is best for a given task based on economic value
- **Justification**: Current frequency routing is manual and could benefit from AI-powered decision making
- **Economic Value**: 92/100

## Implementation

This PR adds:

1. A new `SkFrequencyRouter` class that uses Semantic Kernel to:
   - Analyze a goal and determine the most appropriate cognitive frequency
   - Calculate the economic value of processing a goal at a specific frequency
   - Compare the economic value against frequency thresholds

2. A test class `SkFrequencyRouterTest` that demonstrates the router's capabilities with various scenarios

## Benefits

- Smarter task routing based on context and goal
- Improved economic efficiency by ensuring tasks run at optimal frequencies
- Reduced manual configuration and decision-making

This implementation replaces keyword-based routing with AI-powered semantic understanding.
