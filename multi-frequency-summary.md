# Multi-Frequency Cognitive Architecture

## Overview
The Multi-Frequency Cognitive Architecture operates at different cognitive speeds, from immediate responses to long-term evolution.

## Key Components
- Five frequencies: Immediate (0s), Continuous (30s), Analysis (15m), Optimization (2h), Evolution (24h)
- Core processors for each frequency
- Economic consciousness for value-based execution
- Adaptive scheduling for self-optimization
- GitHub workflow integration
- Strange Loop pattern for recursive self-improvement

## Demo
The simplified demo shows all five frequencies in action, demonstrating the multi-speed cognition capabilities.
