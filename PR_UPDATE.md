# Project Restructuring Summary

This update completes the implementation of the SK Frequency Router by reorganizing the project structure for better maintainability and organization.

## Changes Made

1. **Organized Tools**
   - Created a `tools` directory with subdirectories for different tool types
   - Moved benchmark and visualization scripts to dedicated directories
   - Added utility tools for project maintenance
   - Added comprehensive READMEs with usage instructions

2. **Structured Tests**
   - Created a `tests` directory with subdirectories for different components
   - Moved test scripts to appropriate test directories
   - Updated test scripts to work with the new structure
   - Added README with test documentation

3. **Improved Documentation**
   - Organized documentation in the `docs` directory with component-specific subdirectories
   - Created comprehensive component documentation
   - Added navigation guides and cross-references
   - Created component summaries

4. **Enhanced Source Code Organization**
   - Added READMEs to source directories explaining their purpose
   - Documented the relationships between components
   - Created consistent directory structure across the project

5. **Added Project Maintenance Tools**
   - Created an integration test script to validate the project structure
   - Added a path update helper script to assist with the transition
   - Created a project structure guide to help navigate the codebase

## Benefits

This restructuring provides several key benefits:

1. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with a logical structure
2. **Easier Navigation**: Consistent organization with helpful guides
3. **Improved Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation in logical locations
4. **Simplified Testing**: Dedicated test directories with clear structure
5. **Tool Organization**: Tools grouped by purpose with clear usage instructions

## Testing

The restructuring has been thoroughly tested to ensure backward compatibility:

1. All paths have been updated in scripts and documentation
2. Integration tests validate the new structure
3. Tools and tests run successfully from their new locations
4. A path update helper is included to assist with any remaining references

## Future Work

Moving forward, all new components should follow this structure:

1. Source code in the appropriate subdirectory of `src/`
2. Documentation in `docs/components/`
3. Tests in a dedicated subdirectory of `tests/`
4. Tools in the appropriate subdirectory of `tools/`
