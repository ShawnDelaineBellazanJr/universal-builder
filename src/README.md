## Key Components

### Cognition

The [Cognition](Cognition) directory contains the core cognitive components, including:

- **SK Frequency Router**: Semantic Kernel-based router for intelligent task frequency determination
- **Cognitive Frequency Orchestrator**: Coordinates processing across all cognitive frequencies
- **Frequency Processors**: Specialized processors for each cognitive frequency

### Evolution

The [Evolution](Evolution) directory contains components for system self-improvement, including:

- **SK Evolution Engine**: Analyzes the system and proposes architectural improvements

## Documentation
